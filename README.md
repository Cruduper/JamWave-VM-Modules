## üèÅ Getting Started

### ‚öôÔ∏è Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Buy, download, and install [Voltage Module Designer (VMD)](https://cherryaudio.com/products/voltage-module-designer)_
* _Create a new module inside Module Designer `file > new`_
* _Because VMD locks most of the boilerplate code inside it's editor and only allows you to edit the code in specific user-definable functions, the source code in this repo omits the boilerplate and only contains the snippets of code from the user-definable sections, for your convenience. The portions you will want to copy/paste are the parts directly underneath the `// add your own code here` comments. Some surrounding boilerplate code is kept to make it easier to see which part of the editor code you will need to navigate to in order to paste, but this boilerplate is commented out._
  * _Inside VMD, you can easily skip around to all user-definable functions in the code (`Initialize()`, `Notify()`, `ProcessSample()`, etc) by clicking the corresponding entries in the `Module` window. 
* _In the `// Auto-generated variables` there will be a separate variable for every UI element on the plugin (knobs, sliders, jacks, etc). You will have to manually add each of these elements on to the UI of your plugin, but dragging them one at a time from the `controls` window to the `module` window_
  * _Take note of the naming of the variables of all of the UI elements in code (eg "inputJack1"). When you manually drag UI elements onto your module, you'll have to make sure they are named the same in the `properties` window as they are named in code. You can check the name of a UI element by clicking on it, then looking at the `Variable Name` setting_ 
  * _You may want the `Variable Name`, `Internal Name`, and `Display Name` to all be the same, to avoid any confusion_
* _Once you have copy/pasted all the parts of the code here, and recreated the UI elements and named them correctly, go to the menu `Build > Build` (or hit F7)_
* _Once building is complete, go to `Build > Run without Debugger` (or hit ctrl + F5)_
* _The module should open up in a test environment where you can test its operation_
